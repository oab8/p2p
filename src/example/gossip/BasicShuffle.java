/**
 * @author Lucas Provensi
 * 
 * Basic Shuffling protocol template
 * 
 * The basic shuffling algorithm, introduced by Stavrou et al in the paper: 
 * "A Lightweight, Robust P2P System to Handle Flash Crowds", is a simple 
 * peer-to-peer communication model. It forms an overlay and keeps it 
 * connected by means of an epidemic algorithm. The protocol is extremely 
 * simple: each peer knows a small, continuously changing set of other peers, 
 * called its neighbors, and occasionally contacts a random one to exchange 
 * some of their neighbors.
 * 
 * This class is a template with instructions of how to implement the shuffling
 * algorithm in PeerSim.
 * Should make use of the classes Entry and GossipMessage:
 *    Entry - Is an entry in the cache, contains a reference to a neighbor node
 *  		  and a reference to the last node this entry was sent to.
 *    GossipMessage - The message used by the protocol. It can be a shuffle
 *    		  request, reply or reject message. It contains the originating
 *    		  node and the shuffle list.
 *
